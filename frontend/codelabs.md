## Introduction

The Sharp Ratio is a key financial metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment.

## Research Steps

I conducted a web search to gather information from various financial and investment resources about the Sharp Ratio.

## Main Body

The Sharp Ratio, named after Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, is a measure that helps investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the investment's return and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the investment's excess return. This ratio provides insight into how much excess return is received for the extra volatility endured by holding a riskier asset. A higher Sharp Ratio indicates a more favorable risk-adjusted return.

## Conclusion

The Sharp Ratio is a valuable tool for investors to assess the performance of their investments in relation to the risk taken. It allows for better comparison between different investment opportunities.
